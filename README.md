# LETU-Maker
> Multi-use CNC machine framework capable of 3D Printing, milling, and cutting.

The LETU-Maker is engineered to be a modular CNC framework that can preform a wide variety of tasks. Going beyond a simple 3D printer, LETU-Maker is designed to be robust while remaining cheap and easy to make.

The design makes use of a modules attached to the x-carriage which share a common mounting style and connector pinout making changes quick and easy. Current modules include
1. 3D Printer Extruder
2. Hot Knife Blade
3. Driven-Blade Plotter
4. Rotary Tool Mount

Several other modules are being developed such a laser cutter.
